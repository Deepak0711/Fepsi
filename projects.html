                <p>Celebrations are always sweeter when shared. You are someone who has the ability to
                   become a beacon of hope to others. This year, on your Birthday, be the change you want
                    to see. As a Birthday Gift, give yourself the ability to do something great. Set up a 
                    fundraiser to change somebody’s life for the better. Restore their sense of pride, 
                    self-sufficiency, and independence.
                  We all have the luxury and money to spend it on cakes, gifts, clothes, shoes, and 
                  whatnot. But remember, there are millions of people who don't have more than one pair 
                  of shoes or clothes, don't have a house to live in, they also do not possess enough money
                   to celebrate their birthday. So we, the members of FEPSI came up with the BIRTHDAY
                    CAMPAIGN which is an initiative to celebrate our birthday with children, celebrate
                     our happiness with theirs, and donate whatever you feel like- such as food, clothes,
                      books, money to get a smile on their face.
                  We celebrate our birthday with the children and conduct a donation drive and collect
                   whatever we can books, clothes, pencils, crayons, money, and donate it to the children.</p>

                So we at FEPSI with this basic ideology, have come up with an initiative "Library Campaign", where we are collecting English and Tamil books for primary and secondary school students to set up an entire library in their boarding school. We request you to donate your old books so that your little contribution can become someone's bundle of joy.</p>

It was  made sure that the clothes were provided to the needy and old people that can’t earn, and not to people who are capable of earning. Our mission is to improve the quality of life for the shelter-less to break the cycle of poverty. This event has brought smiles to the ones in need and to the volunteers as well.</p>

            <h1 style="font-size: 400%;" align="center" >Akshaya</h1>
            <p>The food donation drives held my Project Ullas allow us to do our part for the people around us by reducing their plight of hunger because we in FEPSI believe that one of the ways to touch a person’s soul is through food. For most of us, food is easy to come by but the same cannot be said for all of the people around us. Doing our part to feed those in need is an ultimate form of service to humanity as a full stomach brings peace to both the body and the mind.
              Akshaya is a series of food contributions initiated by Ullas. The objective of these food donation drives is to distribute food as a group or individually to the people who have very little access to proper nutrition. Sometimes we also join hands with local trusts and charities in order to get the maximum reach to the people in need. The core belief that we as Fepsians embody is to help and contribute as much as we can, wherever we are because “no one has ever become poor by giving”-Anne Frank.</p>

              <p>A quality that transcends vision into reality is called “Leadership”. And the most important skill a leader poses is to instill that excellence into real life.
                The GLL curriculum covers several events and experiences ranging from fun-filled activities to educational ones which help develop all the skills a leader should possesses, within a span of two semesters. Each event is an enriching experience which helps the participants to learn how to work in a team, improvise and practice their public speaking skills and work on their creativity. The curriculum not only shapes the leaders of tomorrow but also plays a huge role in a vibrant and inquisitive society.
                GLL is like walking into a mirror rather than a door!!!! Towards the path of improvement.</p>
